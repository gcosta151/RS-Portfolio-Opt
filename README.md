The work in these two papers presents a Markov regime-switching factor model to describe the cyclical nature of asset returns in modern financial markets. Maintaining a factor model structure allows us to easily derive the first two moments of the asset return distribution: the expected returns and covariance matrix. By design, these two parameters are calibrated under the assumption of having distinct market regimes. In turn, these regime-dependent parameters serve as the inputs during portfolio optimization, thereby constructing portfolios adapted to the current market environment. The proposed framework leads to a computationally tractable portfolio optimization problem, meaning we can construct large, realistic portfolios. 

## Dependencies ##

- JuMP.jl v1.x
- Ipopt.jl v1.x
- TimeSeries.jl v0.23

## Usage ##
This repository contains all the files used to necessary to run the numerical experiments of the regime-switching portfolio optimization framework. To run the experiments. please refer to the main.jl file. Anyone wishing to make any changes to the models do so by tinkering with a copy of the code base. The code base is made up of the following files:
- dataload/DataLoad.jl: Module to download data from [Kenneth French's data library](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html). Use this module to download returns of the Fama-French three-factor model, as well as the Industry Portfolios to serve as the historical asset returns. 
- optimization/PortfolioOptimization.jl: Module to construct optimal nominal and regime-switching portfolios. Six portfolio optimization models are currently available for use:
 - mvo: Nominal mean-variance optimization
 - rsmvo: Regime-switching mean variance optimization
 - minvar: Nominal minimum variance optimization
 - rsminvar: Regime-switching minimum variance optimization
 - rp: Risk parity portfolio optimization
 - rsrp: Regime-switching risk parity portfolio optimization.
- optimization/Optimization.jl: Supporting script called by the PortfolioOptimization.jl module. This script contains the JuMP-based optimization models.
- optimization/HiddenMarkovModel.jl: Supporting script called by the PortfolioOptimization.jl module. This script contains an implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm to fit a hidden Markov model to the factor returns. 
- optimization/FactorModels.jl: Supporting script called by the PortfolioOptimization.jl module. This script contains an implementation of linear regression under a single regime, as well as under the assumption of multiple regimes.
